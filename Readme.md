# Database Project
This project was done for the BD (Bases de Dados) course. It allowed me to learn about Domain Model creation, abstracting elements and concepts external to a computer into computer data. Learned about relational schemas, normalization and functional dependencies, and how to use AI correctly. I also got familiar with SQL queries and populating databases. 

Done by Bruno Moreira, Guilherme Santos and João Proença.
